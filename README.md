# Step 1. Decomposotion
Decomposition is one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science. It involves breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller parts that are more manageable and easier to understand. The smaller parts can then be examined and solved, or designed individually, as they are simpler to work with.

# Step 2. Abstraction
Abstraction is one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science. It involves filtering out â€“ essentially, ignoring - the characteristics that we don't need in order to concentrate on those that we do.
