Movement functions :
Diver Up Down Left Right and Normal UDLR can be made much simpler just like in Explorer's movement
I only figured this out last minute (when I was doing explorer's movements) RIP but I CBA to change the other movements as they work just as fine.
This can reduce space and make code more efficient but since this program is not much for computers to handle I won't bother :)

Repeated Structure:
A lot of the subprograms have similar structure so they can be improved but I was just trying to get this done :)
